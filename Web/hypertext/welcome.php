			<h1>Welcome to Homework Helper!</h1>
			<hr />
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Homework Helper is a system which helps one complete homework. It works through creating an efficient way for a student
			to enter assignments and due dates. Homework Helper will use the input of what assignments are left and when they are due
			to help the student prioritize assignments and build time-management skills. Homework Helper will only, however, be useful
			if the student inputs vital operating information such as homework and due dates. Homework Helper will also contain many
			useful widgets which can be used to help students take notes and study for exams.</p>
